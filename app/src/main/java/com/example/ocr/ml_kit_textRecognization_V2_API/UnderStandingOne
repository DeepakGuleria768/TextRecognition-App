The ML Kit Text Recognition v2 API can recognize text in any Chinese, Devanagari,
Japanese, Korean and Latin character set. The API can also be used to automate
data-entry tasks such as processing credit cards, receipts, and business cards.


Key capabilities...
1.Recognize text across various scripts and languages Supports recognizing text in Chinese, Devanagari, Japanese, Korean and Latin scripts
2.Analyzes structure of text Supports detection of symbols, elements, lines and paragraphs
3.Identify language of text Identifies the language of the recognized text
4.Real-time recognition Can recognize text in real-time on a wide range of devices


Text structure.....
 The Text Recognizer segments text into blocks, lines, elements and symbols. Roughly speaking:
a. a Block is a contiguous set of text lines, such as a paragraph or column,
b. a Line is a contiguous set of words on the same axis, and
c. an Element is a contiguous set of alphanumeric characters ("word") on the same axis in most Latin languages, or a word in others
d. an Symbol is a single alphanumeric character on the same axis in most Latin languages, or a character in others

For all detected blocks, lines, elements and symbols,
the API returns the bounding boxes, corner points,
rotation information, confidence score, recognized
languages and recognized text.
